# Sundrop Village Redesign — Design

> HPA-238. Branch: `jack65786656/hpa-238-redesign-and-implement-sundrop-village-using-the-layered-map`.
> Scope of this spec: phases 1–3 (preview tooling, design contract, region/collision blockout).
> Phases 4–8 (terrain, objects, decor, visual review, walkthrough) follow in the same branch
> after the blockout preview is approved.

## Problem

The village compiles from `src/lib/game/content/maps/regions/village-layered.ts` through
`compileLayeredRegion`, and the layered infrastructure itself is sound. The *level design*
is not. Three concrete defects, measured from the current source:

1. **Paths do the navigation work.** The `p` route glyph covers 22.3% of walkable cells
   (543 / 2434) and forms slabs, not corridors: rows 8–15 × cols 18–40 is a solid 23×8
   field, the widest horizontal run is 31 tiles, the tallest vertical run is 21 tiles.
2. **Rooms have no boundaries.** The `collision` layer is a perimeter rectangle plus
   scattered fragments — 143 horizontal runs, of which **136 are shorter than 3 tiles**.
   `N` and `S` are unbounded rectangles that exist only as region labels.
3. **No enforced room graph.** Nothing prevents an accidental adjacency that turns the
   layout into a ring road.

Note that total painted coverage (34.3%) is *not* itself the problem, and `c` (4.2%) and
`a` (7.8%) forming blobs is correct — those are room floors the issue explicitly asks for.

## Constraints (from the issue)

- Keep the existing 56×48, 32px layered source; keep origin `{x: 256, y: 4352}`.
- Do not edit `village.ts` beyond its existing `compileLayeredRegion` call.
- Do not modify the layered compiler to solve a level-design problem.
- Do not move global meadow bounds or the village→crossroads corridor.
- Preserve existing semantic IDs and target maps.
- No new assets, gameplay systems, discoveries, encounters, save fields, or HUD behavior.
- Do not weaken design tests to accept the current map.

### Corridor geometry (verified, load-bearing)

The village occupies px `x 256..2048`, `y 4352..5888`. The village→crossroads corridor is a
soft maze of hedges owned by `paths.ts`, spanning cols 44–55, rows −14..+5 in village-tile
coordinates.

**Coordinate convention:** `MapBlocker.x`/`.y` are rect **centers**, not top-left corners
(`WorldScene.ts:2274`: `left = landmark.x - landmark.width / 2`; the compiler emits
`x: (start.x + end.x) / 2`). Footprints below are computed on that basis. Reading them as
top-left shifts every result ~3 cols east and ~2 rows south.

Three external walls intrude into the village grid:

| Wall | Pixel rect | In-grid footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `corridor-wall-2b` | x1775 y4510 170×64 | cols 44–50, rows 3–5 |
| `corridor-wall-3b` | x2010 y4225 64×270 | cols 53–55, row 0 |
| `corridor-wall-5a` | x2040 y4225 64×270 | cols 54–55, row 0 |

Consequences the blockout must respect:

- The exit vents **north** through the existing gap in `collision` row 2 at cols 43–48.
- "East Gate" is a geometric misnomer — it is the north-east corner — but the ID is
  preserved per the semantic-ID constraint.
- The village's own collision layer must not duplicate or fight external walls at
  **cols 44–50 rows 3–5** or **cols 53–55 row 0**. These are the exclusion zones; the
  blockout leaves them empty and lets `paths.ts` own them.
- **Open east shell:** `collision` rows 5–8 have no wall at col 52 — the only solid there is
  col 2 — so cols 3–55 form one unbroken band across the full village width, reachable to
  the east grid edge. `corridor-wall-2b` covers row 5 at cols 44–50, but **rows 6–8 are
  covered by nothing**. Phase 3 must close this deliberately as part of the `E` room
  boundary rather than leaving it to fall out of the blockout.

## Phase 1 — Preview tooling

`tools/preview-layered-region.ts`.

Structure: a pure `renderLayeredPreviews(source: LayeredRegionSource): Map<string, string>`
returning filename → file contents, plus a thin CLI that writes the map to
`docs/superpowers/reports/img/`. The renderer takes any `LayeredRegionSource`, not just the
village, so later regions get previews for free.

Outputs:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `village-regions.svg` | region layer, one fill per room glyph, room labels |
| `village-collision.svg` | collision layer only |
| `village-terrain-paths.svg` | terrain + paths layers |
| `village-designer.svg` | combined: regions tinted, collision solid, decor glyphs, object anchors |
| `village-designer-muted.svg` | same, paths desaturated — the "readable without paths" view |
| `village-objects.md` | landmark/transition/pickup/NPC table derived from source coords |

Determinism: fixed color table, sorted iteration order, no timestamps or absolute paths in
output. Re-running on an unchanged source produces byte-identical files, so a stale preview
shows up as a real diff. Wired as `bun run preview:village`.

The generator is presentation-only. It must not import from `compile-layered-region.ts` for
anything other than types — previews render the *source*, so a compiler bug cannot hide a
design defect.

**Superseding the existing artifact.** `docs/superpowers/reports/img/village-layered-designer-view.svg`
already exists, hand-drawn, and is linked from `2026-07-04-sundrop-layered-village-review.md`
with the subtitle "Paths muted; collision, rooms, decor, and objects emphasized" — the same
view as the new `village-designer-muted.svg`. Phase 1 deletes the hand-drawn file and
repoints the 2026-07-04 report's link at the generated one, so the repo does not carry two
designer views that disagree. The rest of that report is historical and stays as-is.

## Phase 2 — Design contract

New tests in `village-layered.test.ts` (existing tests retained; the `it.each` room
enumeration gains `G`).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical-route corridor width | ≥ 3 tiles | issue §4 |
| Secondary / pocket approach width | ≥ 2 tiles | issue §4 |
| Room opening width | ≥ 2 tiles, ≥ 3 on critical route | issue §3 |
| Min collision run length | ≥ 3 tiles | kills the 136 micro-fragments |
| Route `p` coverage | ≤ 12% of walkable | current 22.3% — binding |
| Route `p` thickness | no 5×5 block entirely `p` | current map has a 23×8 slab — binding |
| Floor `c` / `a` containment | `c` ⊆ P∪G, `a` ⊆ S | terrain identity, not navigation |
| Total painted coverage | ≤ 40% | backstop; current 34.3%, non-binding by itself |
| Transition approach clearance | ≥ 2 free walkable tiles in front | issue §5 |
| Cache distance from main route | ≥ 5 tiles | existing test, retained |

Bounding *thickness* rather than run length is deliberate: a legitimate 3×20 corridor has a
20-tile run along its axis but is only 3 thick, so a run-length cap would reject good
corridors and a 5×5 inscribed-square cap does not.

### The room graph

**Definition of adjacency.** Rooms are separated by a one-tile divider that openings pierce,
so neither raw region-cell contact nor global BFS reachability expresses what we mean —
the first calls rooms non-adjacent despite an opening, the second makes the graph a
trivial star. The test uses reachability restricted to the pair:

> Rooms `A` and `B` are **adjacent** iff some walkable cell labelled `A` is 4-connected to
> some walkable cell labelled `B` by a chain of walkable cells whose labels are all in
> `{A, B, unlabelled}`.

"Walkable" means `layers.collision[row][col] === '.'`; "labelled" means the cell's glyph in
`layers.regions`; "unlabelled" is `.` (divider and interstitial cells). This makes an
opening the *only* way two rooms become adjacent, which is exactly the property tests 2 and
3 constrain the width of.

**Representation.** Every Phase 2 test operates on the **source layers**
(`layers.collision`, `layers.regions`, `layers.paths`), consistent with the existing
`walkableCells()` helper — never on `compileLayeredRegion` output. Landmark rects and
decor-collision rects are compiler outputs and are therefore invisible to these tests by
construction; test 10's "unreachable pocket" cannot be tripped by the well, the fountain,
or the lantern collision boxes.

The strongest test asserts the room adjacency graph equals **exactly** this edge set —
no more, no less:

```
H–P   H–M   H–S        home is the return hub
P–M   P–N   P–S        plaza is the navigation hub
N–G   G–E   E–C        the spine's north half
```

- critical route: `H → P → N → G → E → C`
- west loop: `H → M → P → H`
- shrine loop: `H → S → P → H`

"No ring road" falls out as a consequence rather than needing its own heuristic: `M` and `S`
never touch, and `N/G/E` never touch `M/S`. Any accidental extra adjacency fails the test.

### Test list

Mapping the issue's eleven categories:

1. room connectivity and room graph → exact edge-set equality
2. minimum opening widths → every inter-room gap ≥ 2 (≥ 3 on critical route)
3. one-tile critical chokepoints → every critical-route tile has ≥ 3-wide cross-section
4. west and shrine exploration loops → both simple cycles exist and are distinct
5. landmark-to-region ownership → each landmark anchor sits on its expected glyph
6. transition approach clearance → ≥ 2 walkable tiles in front of each transition
7. NPC and reward reachability → BFS from spawn reaches every object
8. landmark/object overlap → no landmark rects overlap; no object inside a landmark rect
9. path coverage limits → the `p` / `c` / `a` parameters above
10. isolated collision fragments → every run ≥ 3 tiles; no unreachable walkable pocket
11. region ownership of caches → existing tests, retained

## Phase 3 — Region and collision blockout

Approach: **spine + pockets**. One legible critical spine with Market and Shrine hanging off
as pockets that each rejoin at a second point, making them real loops rather than dead ends.

Room extents on the 56×48 grid, keeping the existing outer shell at col 2 / col 52 / row 2 /
row 44:

| Room | Cols | Rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `H` Home Yard | 6–22 | 33–43 |
| `M` Market / Blacksmith | 5–18 | 20–31 |
| `P` Well Plaza | 20–33 | 21–32 (pinched to cols 24–30 at rows 21–23) |
| `N` North Residences | 14–36 | 8–18 |
| `G` Guild Forecourt | 36–48 | 10–18 |
| `E` East Gate | 40–50 | 4–9 |
| `C` Crossroads Corridor | 44–48 | 0–3 |
| `S` Shrine Garden | 25–44 | 33–43 |

### Plaza asymmetry

Load-bearing — this is what stops the plaza reading as a symmetric hedge box:

- fat **west mouth**, 3 wide at rows 25–27, into Market
- pinched 3-tile **north neck**, cols 26–28 at rows 19–20, into the residences
- narrow 2-tile **south opening**, cols 30–31 at row 32, into the Shrine

### Loop-closing links

The room extents above are room *bodies*; rooms are separated by a one-tile divider that the
openings pierce. The Plaza's three openings are specified above. The two remaining links both
close an exploration loop, so if either is omitted the corresponding pocket degrades to a
dead end and the room-graph test fails:

- **H–M**, 2 wide at row 32, cols 8–9 — closes the west loop `H → M → P → H`
- **H–S**, 2 wide at cols 23–24, rows 36–37 — closes the shrine loop `H → S → P → H`

### Walls the room graph forces

Two are easy to miss and both would silently create a ring road:

- **row 19, cols 14–18** must be solid, or Market touches North Residences and
  `H→M→N→G→E` bypasses the plaza entirely.
- **cols 34–51, rows 19–32** (the east flank) must be solid building or hedge mass, or
  Guild Forecourt drains straight down into the Shrine Garden.

### Silhouette requirements

Each room gets a distinct boundary treatment so the village reads with paths hidden:

- `H` — enclosed yard, opens north and east; Hero House anchors the west side
- `M` — narrow working lane, long unbroken west wall, stalls breaking the east edge
- `P` — irregular pentagon, widest at the well, no two openings the same width
- `N` — dense, building masses form the boundary rather than hedge
- `G` — wide institutional forecourt, single deep approach
- `S` — soft organic edge, tree masses instead of hedge runs
- `E` — funnel narrowing toward the corridor mouth

Boundaries use runs of ≥ 3 tiles throughout, replacing the 136 sub-3-tile fragments.

### What Phase 3 does not touch

`paths`, `decor`, and `objects` keep their current content. Intermediate previews will
therefore look wrong on purpose — object anchors will sit in odd places until Phase 5. The
"readable without paths" judgement happens against `village-designer-muted.svg`, which is
exactly the view that ignores the stale path layer.

## Verification

Per stage: regenerate previews, review the muted designer view, run
`bun run test:unit -- --run src/lib/game/content/maps/regions/village-layered.test.ts`.

At the end of phases 1–3: `bun run check`, `bun run lint`, full `bun run test:unit -- --run`.
The e2e suite and the in-game walkthrough belong to phases 7–8.

Automated tests do not constitute completion — the issue is explicit about this, and the
blockout gate is a human preview review.
